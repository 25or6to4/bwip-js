# // Barcode Writer in Pure JavaScript

<a href="http://metafloor.github.io/bwip-js"><img alt="bwipjs" align="right" src="http://metafloor.github.io/bwip-js/images/bwip-js.png"></a>
bwipjs is a translation to native JavaScript of the amazing code provided in [Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript](https://github.com/bwipp/postscriptbarcode).  The translated code can run on any modern browser or JavaScript-based server framework.

bwip-js has finally hit the 1.0 release.  This release uses a newly developed
optimizing PostScript to JavaScript cross-compiler that reduces code size and
improves performance, in some cases an order-of-magnitude decrease in run time.
See the [Version 1.0 Release Announcement](https://github.com/metafloor/bwip-js/wiki/Version-1.0-Release-Announcement) for more details.
