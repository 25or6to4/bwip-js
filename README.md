# // Barcode Writer in Pure JavaScript

<a href="http://metafloor.github.io/bwip-js"><img alt="bwipjs" align="right" src="http://metafloor.github.io/bwip-js/images/bwip-js.png"></a>
bwipjs is a translation to native JavaScript of the amazing code provided in [Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript](https://github.com/bwipp/postscriptbarcode).  The translated code can run on any modern browser or JavaScript-based server framework.

bwip-js has finally hit the 1.0 release.  This release uses a newly developed
optimizing PostScript to JavaScript cross-compiler that reduces code size and
improves performance, in some cases an order-of-magnitude decrease in run time.
See the [Version 1.0 Release Announcement](https://github.com/metafloor/bwip-js/wiki/Version-1.0-Release-Announcement) for more details.

> This is the development branch for bwip-js.
>
> Clone this branch only if you want to compile bwip-js from source.
> If you just want to use the software, then clone the master branch or use
> `npm` to install as a node module:

	npm install bwip-js

## Status 

* Current bwip-js version is 1.0.0 (2016-06-15)
* Current BWIPP version is 2016-06-03

In the future, this page will contain information on all the different scripts
and workflow used to compile and validate bwip-js.  But I am still busy on the
version 1.0 release, so for now, this is all there is.
